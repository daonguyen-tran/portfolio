      "intro": "A passionate student in my third year of a Bachelor's in Computer Science at IUT Robert Schuman (Illkirch-Graffenstaden), I am looking for an internship in software development to complete my degree.",
      "firstYear": "My first year allowed me to build strong foundations in computer science, covering areas such as algorithms, programming, databases, networking, and web development. Other complementary but equally important subjects like mathematics, project management, economics, and technical English also enriched my education. Most courses were deepened throughout the program.",
      "secondYear": "During my second year, the specialization I followed, \"Application Development: Design, Development, Validation\", allowed me to specialize in software development. I deepened my web development skills and discovered React, which became my preferred framework.",
      "internship": "My internship at Viking Cruises in Basel (Switzerland) allowed me to work in an international and agile environment, where I developed an internal application using Microsoft tools (PowerApps, Power BI, Azure DevOps). This highly enriching experience helped me develop my project management skills and understand the importance of user needs comprehension.",
      "thirdYear": "The third year emphasized development practices and quality, with courses on CI/CD, virtualization, testing, and security. I also had the opportunity to develop an application as part of a major project whose client was a member of the Eurometropolis of Strasbourg staff."
